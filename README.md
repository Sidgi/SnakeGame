# SnakeGame

1) Snake wins when it gets 100pts;
2) After collision with square it absorbs that square and becomes bigger on the size of that square and gets 10pts for each 
square;
3) It looses after it hits itself;

Difficulties:
1) Learning canvas;
2) Link the keyboard keys to actual movement of the snake;
3) Optional make it mobile competable;
4) Collision detection

Technologies:
1) DOM elements
2) Canvas
3)Reading keyboard keys

I am planning to foresee the problem with reading books, use resources such as eloiqueant js, Youtube and Google, and MDN.
